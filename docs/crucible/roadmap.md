# Crucible Roadmap
Roadmap for our current planned work alongside with things we may find important to do in between.
## High priority
- [X] Rework the entire build system, installer jar paperclip style and pray the mojang gods does not go after us
- [X] New release type, Crucible Reflux (Thermos with important security and bug fixes, drop in replacement for Thermos)
- [X] Drop the current dev branch, rework the way the stable-dev lifecycle is done
- [X] Crucible wiki and general modding wiki
- [X] Simple welcome website

## Medium priority
- [ ] Guidelines for contribution, make new contributions easy for anyone
- [ ] Finish working the discord server
- [ ] Proper FAQ

## Low priority
- [ ] Mod fixes
- [ ] Automatic unit testing for crucible
- [X] Bring back Crucible Time Machine and other projects to backport cool features
- [ ] Crucible API and implement a bukkit-forge bridge, bukkit plugins provided by mods
