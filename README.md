# (WIP) Crucible Necronomicon, Docs & Knowledge

The place to hold everything about Crucible and bits of legacy minecraft modding.

This project uses Docusaurus for static website generation.


## Contributing

Most contributions can be done without touching code, however you will need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to run a live
test and see your changes. All documentation pages within `./docs` folder are written in 
[Docusaurus's Markdown flavour](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

[Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs) may prove useful for working on this project.

Documentation writing style is yet to be decided, for now follow a style similar to the other pages.
